# Popstar

Popstar is a Valorant internal/external aim assist.

As of now *(23/12/2020)* Popstar is essentially fully functional. Various segments of code can be improved to make detection less likely (i.e. instead of aiming at player head, aim at player body). I will not offer help with this though as I am busy with school and other projects.

If you have questions or concerns please feel free to contact me here or on **Discord @icantcode#5581**.
